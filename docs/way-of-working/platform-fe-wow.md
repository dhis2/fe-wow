### Our values

As a team, we value:

- Continuous improvement: it's not about reaching an ultimate state, but continuously improving on where we are. 
- (Pragmatism): the right balance between doing our best with the resources we have, and the lack of resources becoming a reason for never improving. 
- Empathy: this takes many forms
- Transparency: top-down and down-to-top.

### The Process

From a high-level, we work in iterations to deliver [our roadmap](https://dhis2.org/roadmap/) items during a release cycle (one year).

In the platform team, we work in one-month sprints.

### Process

We will attempt (again) to work in one-month sprints. This hasn't worked perfectly when it comes to the sprints themselves, as the workload was not for the team.

### Short-term

Short sprints of 1-2 weeks are not suitable to the way we work now. Our projects and tasks are often big, and require a lot of exploration that a shorter sprint doesn't align well. We will continue trialing with a one-month sprint, and eventually either adopt, or switch to Kanban, Scrumban or anoher approach.

Daily standups: Given our worldwide distribution, sync daily standups wouldn't work well. We have trialled async standups (3 time per week) and they seem to work. We can continue to tweak them (adjust frequency, questions etc..) to make them better but as they stand, they work better than daily synchronous standups for our context.

Demos: We already do these as part of the demos organised by QA.

## Communication

We are a remote-first team. Our communication tends to be centered around these channels:

- Tuesday meetings: We have two meetings on Tuesday morning. One includes BE + FE teams, followed by one for each team separately. In the joint meeting, we

- "top-down" communication: communicating roadmap, 

- Pull Requests

- Slack

- GitHub Discussions and 

### Guidelines for effective comunication

Effective & responsible communication guidelines - Adapted from https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/

1. Assume Positive Intent. Always begin with a position of positivity and grace.
1. Kindness Matters. You are looking at a screen, but you are really talking to a person. If you wouldn't say it to a person's face, do not send it to them in a text message.
1. Express Your Thoughts Responsibly and Inclusively. We live in different locations and often have very different perspectives. We want to know your thoughts, opinions, and feelings on things. We also ask you to consider the guidelines around communicating potentially sensitive topics.
1. Own It. If you say it or type it, own it. If it hurts the company or an individual, even unintentionally, we encourage you to look at things from other points of view and apologize easily.
1. Feedback is Essential. It is difficult to know what is appropriate in every one of our team members 60+ countries. We encourage team members to give feedback and receive feedback in a considerate way.
1. Do not underestimate a 1:1. Asynchronous communication (e.g., via text) is helpful and necessary. In some cases (e.g., to clarify misunderstandings) it can be much more effective to jump on a video call.
1. Focus on what we can directly influence. There are many factors we can't directly influence and we should avoid spending time discussing those things.


### Meetings
- Tuesday meetings: they are one-way mostly
- Other possible meetings
    - Retros
    - Planning
    - ad-hoc design discussions


### Pull Requests

## Testing standards

## Security and Privacy

### Defintion of Ready

### Defintion of Done




### Discussions / Debates

- **The unbearable muddiness of the "flat hierarchy"**: are we really a flat hierarchy? can the flat hierarchy be a reason for not taking full responsibility? 



## Things not covered in this WoW

### Coding standards
https://github.com/dhis2/cli-style seems to be doing a good job in this regard. Some possible improvements:

- standards for typescript
- ?


### Tools and Technologies
- We will leave the specific tools and technologies out of this document.
